# GUI Testing

This directory contains tests and examples for ImGui Bundle.

**Important** 

* File whose name starts with "test_" are unit tests: 
  They can display a GUI, but their purpose is to verify functionality automatically. So, they should be able to run and complete without user interaction (i.e. close the GUI programmatically).

* File whose name starts with "demo_" are example scripts that visually demonstrate GUI functionality. 
  They are not unit tests, and may require user interaction to close the GUI.
