# Pure Python Backends

HelloImGui and ImmApp use glfw as a default backend. If you wish to use a different backend, it is possible to use sdl2 or pyglet, via pure python backends.

[python_backends](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/python_backends) contains pure python backends for glfw, pyglet, sdl2 and sdl3. They do not offer the same DPI handling as HelloImGui, but they are a good starting point if you want to use alternative backends.

See [examples](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/python_backends/examples) for more information.
