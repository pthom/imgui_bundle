# ImGui Bundle Documentation

Welcome to the new documentation for ImGui Bundle, reworked with Jupyter Book.

This documentation is designed as a **Cookbook** to help you quickly find recipes for your applications, while also providing deep-dives into the core "Runners" that power the bundle.

## What is ImGui Bundle?

ImGui Bundle is a "batteries-included" library that brings the power of **Dear ImGui** to Python and C++, along with a collection of curated libraries for plotting, node editing, markdown rendering, and more.
