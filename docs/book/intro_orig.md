# ImGui Bundle Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **ImGui Bundle**, a "batteries-included" toolkit for creating powerful Immediate Mode GUIs in Python and C++.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you are new to the project, we recommend starting here:

*   **[Overview](intro/overview.md)**: What is ImGui Bundle, and why use Immediate Mode GUI?
*   **[Quick Start](intro/quickstart.md)**: Install the bundle and run your first "Hello, World" in minutes.

## 🛠️ The Core Engine: Runners

At the heart of every ImGui Bundle application is a **Runner**. We provide powerful abstractions that handle the window lifecycle, docking, and multi-platform support:

*   **[Basic Runners](runners/basic.md)**: Introduction to Hello ImGui and ImmApp.
*   **[Layout & Docking](runners/layout_docking.md)**: Building complex workspaces.

## 📖 The Cookbook

Looking for a specific feature? Explore our **Cookbook & Recipes**, grouped by goal:

*   **[Data Visualization](cookbook/data_viz.md)**: 2D and 3D plotting with ImPlot.
*   **[Editors & Tools](cookbook/editors.md)**: Text editing and Markdown.
*   **[Computer Vision](cookbook/vision.md)**: High-performance image inspection with ImmVision.
