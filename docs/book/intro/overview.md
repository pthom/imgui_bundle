# Overview: Immediate Mode GUI with ImGui Bundle

(This page is adapted from the [ImGui Python Intro](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/docs/docs_md/imgui_python_intro.md))

## What is Immediate Mode GUI?

An "Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface" lets you build user interfaces directly in code.
This keeps the UI and app state in perfect sync with minimal boilerplate. This approach is especially popular for quick prototyping and tools because it's intuitive, flexible, easy to maintain, and trivial to debug.

### The Paradigm in a Nutshell

In a traditional GUI, you create objects (widgets) and then update them when your data changes.
In **Immediate Mode**, the UI is "rebuilt" every frame based on the current data.

```python
from imgui_bundle import imgui, immapp

counter = 0 # our app state

# The gui() function is called every frame
def gui():
    global counter
    imgui.text(f"Counter ={counter}")

    if imgui.button("increment counter"):
        counter += 1

    value_changed, counter = imgui.slider_int("Set counter", counter, 0, 100)

immapp.run(gui)
```

## Immediate GUI in Python with Dear ImGui Bundle

The most popular Immediate Mode GUI library is [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), a powerful **C++** library originally created for real-time tools in game engines.

**Dear ImGui Bundle** brings full Dear ImGui support to Python, plus many extra libraries, making it ideal for rapid prototyping as well as building complex apps with advanced widgets, plotting, node editors, and more.

### Key Benefits

*   **Batteries Included**: One install gives you ImPlot, ImmVision, Node Editors, and more.
*   **Fully Documented**: The Python bindings are heavily documented for excellent IDE auto-completion.
*   **Always Up-to-Date**: Bindings are autogenerated from the C++ source.

## Anatomy of an application

`imgui_bundle` is a Unified package that includes:

*   **imgui**: The core library.
*   **implot** & **implot3d**: High-performance plotting.
*   **imgui_md**: Markdown rendering.
*   **hello_imgui**: Application runner (docking, assets, etc.).
*   **immapp**: Helper for easy initialization of add-ons.

```python
import numpy as np
from imgui_bundle import imgui, implot, imgui_md, hello_imgui, immapp

def gui():
    imgui_md.render_unindented("# Animated Plot with ImPlot")

    if implot.begin_plot("Plot", size=hello_imgui.em_to_vec2(40, 20)):
        x = np.arange(0, np.pi * 4, 0.01)
        y = np.cos(x + imgui.get_time())
        implot.plot_line("y(x)", x, y)
        implot.end_plot()

immapp.run(gui, with_implot=True, with_markdown=True)
```

## Deployment Options

Dear ImGui Bundle apps are highly portable:

1.  **Standalone scripts**: Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2.  **Jupyter notebooks**: Interactive UI inside your notebook environment.
3.  **Web (Pyodide)**: Run your Python app directly in the browser via a static HTML file.
