## Dear ImGui Bundle Explorer

[Dear ImGui Bundle Explorer](https://traineq.org/imgui_bundle_explorer) lets you explore the features of Dear ImGui Bundle in your web browser.

Pay attention to the "Demo Apps" tab, which contains many examples built with Dear ImGui Bundle.
You can read the documentation, run the demos, and even view the source code (in C++ and Python) directly from the manual!
