# Quick Code Comparison

## Immediate Mode (Dear ImGui Bundle) 

Unlike many "GUI frameworks," Dear ImGui Bundle embraces the **immediate mode** paradigm.
The code reads like a book:

```python
from imgui_bundle import imgui, hello_imgui

selected_idx = -1
items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

def gui():
    global selected_idx
    imgui.text("Choose a fruit:")
    _changed, selected_idx = imgui.list_box("Choose a fruit", selected_idx, items)
    imgui.text(f"You selected: {items[selected_idx]}")

hello_imgui.run(gui, window_title="Fruit Picker")
```
**Characteristics:**
- State lives in your code (`selected_idx` variable)
- Logic and UI are together (easy to reason about)
- No widget objects to manage
- Changes are immediate

## vs Retained Mode (Qt)

Qt uses a **retained mode** paradigm. 
The code is a bit more involved, as you need to set up a widget tree and manage signals/slots.
The same application would look like this:

```python
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QListWidget

selected_idx = 0
items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

class FruitPicker(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        layout = QVBoxLayout()

        self.label = QLabel("Choose a fruit:")
        self.list_widget = QListWidget()
        self.list_widget.addItems(items)
        self.result_label = QLabel(f"You selected: {items[selected_idx]}")

        self.list_widget.currentRowChanged.connect(self.on_selection_changed)

        layout.addWidget(self.label)
        layout.addWidget(self.list_widget)
        layout.addWidget(self.result_label)
        self.setLayout(layout)

    def on_selection_changed(self, index):
        global selected_idx
        selected_idx = index
        self.result_label.setText(f"You selected: {items[selected_idx]}")

app = QApplication([])
window = FruitPicker()
window.show()
app.exec()
```

**Trade-offs:**
- More boilerplate (widget tree, signals/slots)
- State can live in widgets or your code (synchronization needed, via signals)
- Steeper learning curve
- More powerful for complex traditional UIs


# Common Questions

## Is It Interesting for Developers?

**Absolutely yes**, for several reasons:

### 1. Joy of Use

The immediate-mode paradigm is genuinely refreshing:

```python
# Your code directly expresses intent
if imgui.button("Click Me"):
    do_something()
```

This is more readable and maintainable than callback spaghetti or complex widget trees.


### 2. Rapid Development

From zero to functional UI is remarkably fast:
- No UI designer needed
- No XML/JSON layouts to maintain
- Changes appear immediately
- Easy to iterate

### 3. Power When You Need It

The framework scales from simple to complex:
- Start with a simple window and buttons
- Add docking and multiple windows
- Incorporate 3D visualization
- Build node-based editors
- Create custom widgets

All while maintaining code clarity.

### 4. Cross-Platform Reality

The cross-platform support actually works:
- Same code runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
- WebAssembly with Python runtime (!!)
- No platform-specific hacks needed
- Mobile support (iOS, Android) is real (in C++)

### 5. Active Community

- Dear ImGui itself has 70k+ stars and is used in AAA games
- Dear ImGui Bundle is based on Dear ImGui and adds comprehensive Python support
- 1k+ stars
- Regular updates and maintenance, keeping up with Dear ImGui upstream
- Responsive to issues


## "Isn't rebuilding the UI every frame slow?"

**No!** Because:
- Widget calls are cheap (just generate drawing commands)
- Actual rendering is GPU-accelerated
- Typical frame times: < 1ms for most UIs
- Easily achieves 60+ FPS even with complex interfaces

## "How's the Python performance?"

**Excellent!** Because:
- Each widget call crosses to C++ once per frame
- Heavy lifting (rendering) is in C++
- Python overhead is < 0.5ms per frame typically
- Real bottleneck is usually your application logic, not the GUI

## "Does it work on the web?"

**Yes, impressively!**
- C++ → Emscripten → WebAssembly
- Python → Pyodide → WebAssembly (!!)
- Full Python runtime in browser
- Native-speed rendering via WebGL
