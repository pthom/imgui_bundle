# Dear ImGui Bundle

> “Dear ImGui Bundle: easily create applications in Python and C++. Batteries included! With very few lines of code, you can build a responsive GUI, and deploy it to desktop or directly in the browser.”

Dear ImGui Bundle is a collection of libraries around [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), for both C++ and Python. It focuses on rapid prototyping, tooling, and educational demos, with first‑class support for desktop and web.

## Key features

- Cross‑platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly.
- C++ and Python APIs with very similar structure.
- Integrated ecosystem:
  - Dear ImGui (core widgets)
  - ImPlot / ImPlot3D (2D and 3D plotting)
  - ImmVision (image inspection)
  - imgui-node-editor, ImGuizmo, file dialogs, knobs, spinners, toggles, command palette, and more.
- Optional high‑level runners:
  - Hello ImGui: window, backend, docking, and assets management.
  - ImmApp: easy activation of add‑ons (ImPlot, Markdown, etc.).
- Web‑ready:
  - C++ via Emscripten
  - Python via Pyodide (online playground and deployable HTML templates)

> “Think of it as a toolbox where all the pieces are pre‑wired to play well together: plotting, Markdown, node editors, image inspection, and more, ready to drop into your app.”

## Documentation and interactive explorer

### Documentation site

This site contains the full documentation for Dear ImGui Bundle, including install instructions, conceptual introductions, step‑by‑step tutorials, deployment recipes, etc. It is a companion to "Dear ImGui Bundle Explorer", an Explorer below.

### Interactive manual & demo

Click the image below to launch the interactive manual in your web browser:

</a>

The interactive manual showcases almost every part of the bundle with runnable examples. You can:
- Explore core Dear ImGui widgets.
- Try plotting, node editors, image viewers, test engine, and more.
- Inspect and copy the C++ and Python source code for each demo.

> “The interactive manual is intended to be your live reference: browse widgets, run demos, and copy code snippets directly into your own projects.”


### Online playground (Pyodide):
Run and edit Python ImGui Bundle apps directly in your browser:
- No installation.
- Type code on the left, see the interactive GUI on the right.
- Great for experimentation, teaching, and sharing small examples.

Open the [playground](https://traineq.org/imgui_bundle_online/projects/imgui_bundle_playground/).
