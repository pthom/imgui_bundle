# ImGui Bundle
[ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) is a bundle for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git), including various useful libraries from its ecosystem.
It enables to easily create ImGui applications in C++, as well as in Python.

The python bindings were autogenerated from the original C++ code, so that they are easier to keep up to date, and the python API closely matches the C++ api, making it possible to easily port research code from Python to C++.

* [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot): Immediate Mode Plotting
* [Hello ImGui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui.git): cross-platform Gui apps with the simplicity of a "Hello World" app 
* [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo.git): Immediate mode 3D gizmo for scene editing and other controls based on Dear Imgui

* [imgui-knobs](https://github.com/altschuler/imgui-knobs): Knobs widgets for ImGui
* [ImFileDialog](https://github.com/pthom/ImFileDialog.git): A file dialog library for Dear ImGui  
* [imgui_md](https://github.com/mekhontsev/imgui_md.git): Markdown renderer for Dear ImGui using MD4C parser
* [imspinner](https://github.com/dalerank/imspinner): Set of nice spinners for imgui 
* [imgui_toggle](https://github.com/cmdwtf/imgui_toggle): A toggle switch widget for Dear ImGui. [Homepage](https://cmd.wtf/projects#imgui-toggle)
* [ImmVision](https://github.com/pthom/immvision.git): immediate image debugger and insights 
* [imgui_tex_inspect](https://github.com/andyborrell/imgui_tex_inspect): A texture inspector tool for Dear ImGui 

## Philosophy
* Closely mirrors the original API of ImGui and other libraries
* Original code documentation is consciously kept inside the python stubs. See for example the documentation for:
    * [imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui.pyi)
    * [implot](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi)
    * [hello imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)
* Fully typed bindings, so that code completion works like a charm


## ImGui Backend

ImGui Bundle uses [Hello ImGui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui), which is configured to use GLFW + OpenGL3.
Under C++, this is configurable (see Hello ImGui docs), with some adaptations inside on the [cmake side](cmake/add_hello_imgui.cmake).

# Usage with Python

## Install

````bash
# Install from pypi
pip install imgui-bundle

# or install from clone
git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
cd imgui_bundle
pip install -v .
````

## Demo

````bash
# imgui_bundle_demo will run the full demo shown on this page. 
# It also acts as a manual for ImGui Bundle with lots of examples and related code source.
imgui_bundle_demo 
````

The source for the demos can be found inside [bindings/imgui_bundle/demos](bindings/imgui_bundle/demos).

# Usage with C++

````
git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
````

Then, take inspiration from [demos_cpp/demo_haiku_implot_heart](demos_cpp/demo_haiku_implot_heart), 
or [demos_cpp/demo_widgets_docking](demos_cpp/demo_widgets_docking)
