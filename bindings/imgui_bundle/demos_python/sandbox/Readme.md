The directory bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/sandbox contains readable example scripts for ImGui Bundle, that
demonstrate features. They are intended to be read and modified by users to learn how to use ImGui Bundle.
They should be short and simple, and not contain complex logic or automated tests.

They should be named sandbox_*.py to distinguish them from unit tests (test_*.py) and demos (demo_*.py).
