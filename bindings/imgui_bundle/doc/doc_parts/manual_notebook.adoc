ImmApp adds support for integration inside jupyter notebook: the application will be run in an external window, and a screenshot will be placed on the notebook after execution.

This requires a window server, and will not run on Google collab.

Below is a screenshot, that you can test by running `jupyter notebook` inside `bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/notebooks`
