=== Debug native {cpp} in python scripts

ImGui Bundle provides tooling to help you debug the {cpp} side, when you encounter a bug that is difficult to diagnose from Python.

It can be used in two steps:

1. Edit the file `pybind_native_debug/pybind_native_debug.py`. Change its content so that it runs the python code you would like to debug. Make sure it works when you run it as a python script.
2. Now, debug the {cpp} project `pybind_native_debug` which is defined in the directory `pybind_native_debug/`. This will run your python code from {cpp}, and you can debug the {cpp} side (place breakpoints, watch variables, etc).
