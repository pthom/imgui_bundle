# Plan: rework imgui bundle to use jupyter book


## Initial objectives and info given by the user

The goal is to migrate the documentation to Jupyter Book.
- **Context**: The existing AsciiDoc documentation is hard to maintain. The user wants consistency with other projects (Hello ImGui, Litgen) that use Jupyter Book.
- **Problem**: The existing outline is insufficient and too close to the API structure.
- **Requirement**: The new docs should be more "Cookbook" style, inspired by the `demo_immapp_launcher.py`.
- **Constraint**: Must handle both Python (primary) and C++ (secondary) users effectively.

### References

- `bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/demo_immapp_launcher.py`: Good source for functional categories.
- `docs/docs_md/imgui_python_intro.md`: Good intro material.
- `bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/`: Source of truth for examples.

## Proposed Strategy

### 1. Structure: "Cookbook" / Functional Approach
Instead of listing libraries one by one, we will group them by **what the user wants to achieve**.

### 2. Dual Language Support (Python First)
Since the Python user base is larger, the primary narrative will be in Python.
- **Code Examples**: Use tabbed code blocks (Sphinx Design) to show "Python" and "C++" side-by-side where applicable.
- **APIs**: Focus on the Python API, but mention C++ differences (mostly naming conventions) in a dedicated explanation or "Porting" guide.

### 3. Proposed Table of Contents (TOC)

*   **Introduction**
    *   **Overview**: philosophy, "batteries included" details.
    *   **Gallery**: Screenshots + links to demos.
    *   **Quick Start**:
        *   Python: `pip install imgui-bundle` + "Hello World".
        *   C++: CMake/vcpkg + "Hello World".

*   **The Basics (Essential Concepts)**
    *   **Immediate Mode Paradigm**: Brief explainer (sync with app state).
    *   **Widgets 101**: Text, Buttons, Sliders, Input (Standard ImGui).


*   **Runners (Hello ImGui and Immapp)**
    *   **Basic**: Start an application loop, create windows, etc.
        The loop, window setup, assets.
        Hello ImGui and Immapp intro here
    *   **Layout & Docking**: Building the workspace.
        also add ImmApp intro here
    *   **User Settings & Persistence**
    *   **Theming**
    *   **Idling and powersaving**
    *  **Misc**
        *   Logging
        *   Status Bar
        *   Dpi scaling with EmSize EmToVec2

*   **Python Specifics**
    *   **The "Pythonic" Way**: Context managers (`with imgui.begin():`), Pydantic integration.
    *   **API Reference**: (Link to autogenerated stubs / separate searchable index).

    * **Using in a notebook**:
    * **Using on the web via Pyodide**:
    *   **Desktop**: PyInstaller / Standalone builds.

    * **Using with a pure python backend**:
    *   **Porting from C++**:
        *   Reference table (Enums, Pointers <-> Mutable types).
        *   Adapting C++ examples.

*   **Cookbook & Recipes** (Inspired by `demo_immapp_launcher`)
    *   **Data Visualization**:
        *   2D Plotting (ImPlot).
        *   3D Plotting (ImPlot3D).
        *   Scientific Plotting (Matplotlib integration).
    *   **Editors & Tools**:
        *   Text/Code Editor.
        *   Markdown Rendering.
    *   **Images & Computer Vision**:
        *   Image Inspection (ImmVision).
        *   Texture viewing.
-    *   **Widgets**:
        *   Command Palette.
        *   ...
    *   **Custom Backgrounds**
    *   **Utilities**:
        *   Gizmos (3D manipulation).
        *   Node Graph Editor.



### 4. Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Initialize Jupyter Book in `docs/book`.
- [ ] specific configuration for tabs (`sphinx-design`).
- [ ] Github Actions workflow for deployment.

#### Phase 2: Content Migration (Iterative)
- **Iteration 1: Fundamentals**
    - Migrating `intro.md` and `installation`.
    - Creating the "Hello World" (Python/C++ tabs) page.
- **Iteration 2: The Cookbook**
    - Porting demos from `demo_immapp_launcher.py`.
    - For each demo entry:
        1.  Extract the description.
        2.  Take a screenshot.
        3.  Link to the source code (GitHub).
        4.  Provide a simplified code snippet (Python).
- **Iteration 3: Advanced & Validation**
    - Porting "Porting Guide" and FAQ.
    - verifying links and Pyodide integration.

### 5. Source Mapping (Revised)

| Function/Topic | Major Demo Source (`demos_python/`) | New Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intro** | `demo_immapp_launcher` | `intro/index.md` |
| **Plotting** | `demo_implot.py` | `cookbook/plotting.md` |
| **Nodes** | `demo_node_editor_launcher.py` | `cookbook/node_editor.md` |
| **Text Edit** | `demo_text_edit.py` | `cookbook/text_editor.md` |
| **Markdown** | `demo_imgui_md.py` | `cookbook/markdown.md` |
| **Vision** | `demo_immvision_launcher.py` | `cookbook/vision.md` |
| **Themes** | `demo_themes.py` | `cookbook/themes.md` |
| **Context Managers** | `demo_utils/api_demos.py` | `python/context_managers.md` |

## Next Steps
1.  **Approval**: Confirm this revised structure aligns with your vision.
2.  **Implementation**: I can start by creating the directory structure and the configuration files.
