name: Wheels (minimal)

# This workflow builds minimal wheels **without**
#    hello_imgui, immapp, imgui_md, im_file_dialog, imgui_tex_inspect,
#    immvision, imgui_test_engine, and the glfw backend.
# Wheels are available as downloadable artifacts from the Actions tab (only for Python 3.14).
#
# To build such a wheel yourself, set the environment variable IMGUI_BUNDLE_WITH_HELLO_IMGUI=OFF:
#    IMGUI_BUNDLE_WITH_HELLO_IMGUI=OFF python -m build --wheel
