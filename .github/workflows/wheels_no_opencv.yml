# This workflow builds wheels without OpenCV/ImmVision dependency

# Wheels are available as downloadable artifacts from the Actions tab (only for Python 3.14).

# To build such a wheel yourself, set the environment variable IMGUI_BUNDLE_WITH_IMMVISION=OFF:
#    IMGUI_BUNDLE_WITH_IMMVISION=OFF python -m build --wheel
