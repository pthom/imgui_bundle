  name: imgui-bundle

source:
  # Here, we use a clean sdist that's copied into the container
  # Source: ci_scripts/docker_pyodide/docker_pyodide_resources/imgui_bundle_sdist
  # Created from: python -m build --sdist (respects sdist.exclude in pyproject.toml)
  # Copied to container at: /mnt/imgui_bundle_sdist
  #
  # Why copy instead of mount? Because any symlinks in virtualenvs would be broken,
  # and pyodide's build system (shutil.copytree) fails on broken symlinks.

build:
  # imgui-bundle needs to link with relocatable versions of SDL2 and html5.
  # By default, emscripten builds the non-relocatable version of these libraries,
  # so we need to trigger the build of the relocatable (-fPIC) versions.
  # See https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/5248 for more explanations.
